This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Python-based data analysis project for KUNI 2thecore that provides data analysis reports for car rental companies. The project analyzes rental car usage patterns, brand preferences, seasonal trends, and location optimization using MySQL database connectivity and advanced data analysis capabilities.

### Business Purpose
The system provides data-driven insights to rental car companies using two main data sources:
- **car** table: Vehicle information including model, brand, year, type, status, and location
- **drivelog** table: Driving records with trip details, timestamps, locations, and events

### Core Services Provided
1. **Seasonal Brand/Vehicle Preference Analysis** - Monthly and seasonal analysis of preferred brands and vehicles with seasonality evaluation
2. **Trend Analysis** - Year-over-year changes in brand and vehicle preferences 
3. **Daily Vehicle Usage Forecasting** - Daily operational vehicle count analysis with linear regression forecasting (1 week to 1 month ahead)
4. **Location Clustering Analysis** - Regional importance quantification for optimal rental location placement

## Environment Setup

The project requires a virtual environment with dependencies installed from `requirements.txt`:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Verify setup
python verify_setup.py
```

## Database Configuration

The project uses MySQL with SQLAlchemy and requires a `.env` file with database credentials:
- DB_HOST
- DB_USER  
- DB_PASSWORD
- DB_NAME
- DB_PORT

Database connection and data loading functionality is centralized in `src/data_loader.py`.

## Development Workflow

Common development commands for this data analysis project:

```bash
# Verify environment setup (import test)
python verify_setup.py

# Test database connection and data loading
python src/data_loader.py

# Start Flask web server (development)
python app.py
# or (preferred production runner)
python run_server.py

# Start Jupyter for interactive analysis
jupyter lab

# Test individual analysis modules
python -m src.simple_preference_analysis

```

## Flask Web Server

The project includes a Flask-based REST API server for data analysis:

- **Main Application**: `app.py` - Core Flask application with REST API endpoints
- **Server Runner**: `run_server.py` - Development server startup script
- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:5000`

### Available API Endpoints

**Core System Endpoints:**
- `GET /` - API information and available endpoints  
- `POST /api/data` - Execute SQL queries and return results as JSON
- `GET /api/health` - Health check and database connectivity status

**Data Analysis Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/analysis/period` - Monthly/seasonal brand and vehicle preference analysis (implemented in `src/simple_preference_analysis.py`)
